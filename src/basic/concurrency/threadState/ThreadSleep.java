 * The thread moves from the RUNNABLE state to the TIMED_WAITING state.
 * It remains in TIMED_WAITING for the duration specified in the sleep() call (in milliseconds or milliseconds + nanoseconds).
 * While in this state, the thread is not consuming CPU resources—it’s effectively paused, allowing other threads to run.
 * Once the sleep duration expires (or if the thread is interrupted), the thread returns to the RUNNABLE state, where it becomes eligible to resume execution.
 *
 * Key Characteristics of TIMED_WAITING with sleep():
 * The thread does not release any locks/monitors it holds (unlike wait(), which releases the monitor).
 * If the thread is interrupted (via interrupt()), it exits the TIMED_WAITING state early, throws an
