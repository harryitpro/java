/**
 * longest substring
 * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters – A common coding problem that involves finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.
 * Longest Palindromic Substring – Finding the longest contiguous substring that is a palindrome.
 * Longest Common Substring – Finding the longest common substring between two given strings.

/**
 * Tips for Interview Preparation
 * Practice Variations: Be prepared for variations of this problem, such as finding the longest substring with at most k distinct characters, or finding the actual substring (not just its length). For the latter, you’d need to track the start and end indices of the maximum window.
 * Explain Your Thought Process: During the interview, walk through your approach before coding. Explain why you chose a hash map over a set, or how you handle edge cases (e.g., empty strings, single characters).
 * Test Edge Cases: Be ready to test your solution with edge cases, such as empty strings, strings with all repeated characters ("aaaa"), or strings with spaces and special characters ("a b c").
 * Optimize for Banking Context: If the interviewer asks for a banking-related twist (e.g., processing a stream of transaction IDs), think about how to adapt the solution, such as ensuring thread safety for concurrent processing or handling large-scale data.
 * If You Meant a Different Problem
 * If you were referring to a different "longest substring" problem (e.g., longest common substring, longest palindromic substring), please clarify, and I can provide a tailored solution. For example:
 *
 * Longest Common Substring: Involves two strings and is often solved using dynamic programming.
 * Longest Palindromic Substring: Involves finding a substring that reads the same forward and backward, often solved using the "expand around center" approach or dynamic programming.
 * Let me know if you need further assistance or a solution in a different programming language (e.g., Java, which is common at Citi Bank)!
