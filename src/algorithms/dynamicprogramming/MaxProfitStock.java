/**
 * Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Max Profit)
 * The goal is to maximize profit by buying at a lower price and selling at a higher price.
 *
 * 1. Problem Statement
 * Given an array prices[] where prices[i] represents the stock price on the i-th day, find the maximum profit by choosing a single buy and single sell.
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰ You must buy before selling.
 *
 * Example
 * Input:  prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy at **1**, sell at **6** â†’ **Profit = 6 - 1 = 5**
 * Input:  prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: No profitable transaction possible.

 * 2. Optimized Approach (O(n) Time, O(1) Space)
 * Track the lowest price so far.
 * Calculate profit at each step:
 * profit = current_price - min_price_so_far
 * Keep track of the maximum profit.
