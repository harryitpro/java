Citi Bank's coding interview typically involves data structures, algorithms, system design, and problem-solving questions. The difficulty level is usually medium to hard on platforms like LeetCode. Here are some common types of questions:

1. Data Structures & Algorithms
Arrays & Strings
Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers that add up to a specific target.

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[]{map.get(complement), i};
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return new int[]{};
}
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example: "abcabcbb" → 3 ("abc")
Solution: Use Sliding Window.
Linked Lists
Reverse a Linked List

Reverse a singly linked list.
Solution: Use iteration or recursion.
Example (Java):
java
Copy
Edit
public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
    ListNode prev = null;
    ListNode current = head;
    while (current != null) {
        ListNode next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    return prev;
}
Detect a Cycle in a Linked List

Use Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm (slow & fast pointers).
Stacks & Queues
Valid Parentheses

Given a string with ()[]{}, check if it's valid.
Solution: Use Stack.
Implement LRU Cache

Use HashMap + Doubly Linked List.
Trees & Graphs
Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Solution: Use BFS (Queue).
Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

Given a BST and two nodes, find their lowest common ancestor.
Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Find the shortest path in a graph using PriorityQueue.
Dynamic Programming (DP)
Climbing Stairs (f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2))
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
2. SQL & Database
Find the second-highest salary
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);
Find duplicate records in a table
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
3. System Design (For Experienced Candidates)
Design a URL Shortener (like Bit.ly)
Design a Banking Transaction System
Design a Load Balancer
