How to Prioritize Tasks Under Tight Deadlines?
When facing multiple tasks under pressure, using a structured approach helps you stay focused, avoid burnout, and meet deadlines efficiently. Here’s how:

1️⃣ Identify and List All Tasks
Write down all tasks that need to be completed.
Break larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
Identify deadlines and dependencies (tasks that rely on others).
✅ Tool Tip: Use a To-Do List, Kanban Board, or Task Manager (e.g., Trello, Notion, Asana).

2️⃣ Prioritize Using the Eisenhower Matrix
Categorize tasks based on urgency and importance:

Category	Action	Example
Urgent & Important	Do it immediately	Fixing a critical bug, responding to a high-priority client issue
Important but Not Urgent	Schedule it	Preparing a long-term report, learning a new tool
Urgent but Not Important	Delegate it	Answering routine emails, administrative work
Neither Urgent nor Important	Eliminate it	Unnecessary meetings, distractions
✅ Focus on high-impact tasks first!

3️⃣ Apply the 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)
80% of outcomes come from 20% of the effort.
Identify high-impact tasks that bring the most results.
✅ Example:
If you have 5 tasks, but one task will solve multiple issues, prioritize that one first.

4️⃣ Use Time Management Techniques
🔹 Time Blocking
Allocate specific time slots for each task.
Helps prevent context switching (jumping between tasks).
Example:
makefile
Copy
Edit
9:00 - 10:00 AM → Code review  
10:00 - 11:00 AM → Critical bug fix  
11:30 - 12:30 PM → Team meeting  
🔹 Pomodoro Technique (For Focus)
Work in 25-minute focused sprints, then take a 5-minute break.
Keeps energy levels high.
✅ Use tools like Focus Booster, Pomodone, or a simple timer.

5️⃣ Handle Interruptions & Say "No"
Avoid distractions (mute notifications, use "Do Not Disturb" mode).
If new tasks come up, assess urgency before saying “yes”.
✅ Example: If someone asks for a non-urgent report, say:
"I can work on it after completing the high-priority task at hand."

6️⃣ Stay Flexible & Adapt
If priorities change, adjust quickly.
Communicate with your team if help is needed.
Focus on progress, not perfection.
